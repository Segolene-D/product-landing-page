    <h2>Who they are</h2>
    <p>A cactus (plural cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus)is a member of the plant family Cactaceae, a family
      comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales. The word "cactus" derives,
      through Latin, from the Ancient Greek κάκτος, kaktos, a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant
      whose identity is now not certain. Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Most cacti live in habitats
      subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert,
      one of the driest places on earth. Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. Almost all cacti are succulents,
      meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the
      only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves,
      retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores, spines help
      prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of leaves,
      enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis. Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to
      parts of western Canada in the north—except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.

    <h2>How they survive</h2>
    <p>
      Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced branch. Areoles
      are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular
      and multipetaled. Many cacti have short growing seasons and long dormancies, and are able to react quickly to any
      rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the
      ground surface. Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick
      water absorption after rain, followed by long drought periods. Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a
      special mechanism called "crassulacean acid metabolism" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis. Transpiration, during
      which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes, does not take place during the day at the same time as
      photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night. The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid,
      retaining it until daylight returns, and only then using it in photosynthesis. Because transpiration takes place
      during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss is significantly reduced.

    <h2>Their forms</h2>
    <p>Many smaller cacti have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume for water storage, with the
      lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration. The tallest[Note 2] free-standing cactus is
      Pachycereus pringlei, with a maximum recorded height of 19.2 m (63 ft),[6] and the smallest is Blossfeldia
      liliputiana, only about 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter at maturity. A fully grown saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said
      to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons (760 l; 170 imp gal) of water during a rainstorm. A few species
      differ significantly in appearance from most of the family. At least superficially, plants of the genus Pereskia
      resemble other trees and shrubs growing around them. They have persistent leaves, and when older, bark-covered
      stems. Their areoles identify them as cacti, and in spite of their appearance, they, too, have many adaptations
      for water conservation. Pereskia is considered close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved. In
      tropical regions, other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes (plants that grow on trees). Their stems are
      typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with fewer or even no spines, such as the well-known
      Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus (in the genus Schlumbergera).
